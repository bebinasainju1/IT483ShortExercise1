        <h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
        holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
        Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>

        <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween
        pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep
        you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
